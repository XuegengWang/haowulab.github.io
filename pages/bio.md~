description: Hao Wu's Short bio
---

I was born in Beijing and grew up in Tianjin, China. 
I graduated from the <a href="http://www.nkzx.cn/">Tianjin Nankai High School</a>, 
which produced two Chinese prime ministers and numuerous scientists. 
I received my BS degree from
<a href="http://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/eng/index.html">Tsinghua University</a>,
Department of Electrical Engineering in 1996 and MS degree
from <A href="http://www.iastate.edu/">Iowa State University</A>,
Department of Electrical Engineering in 2000.
<p>
In early 2000 I started to work in a branch of 
<a href="http://www.gepower.com/">GE Energy</a>
as an engineer. I was in a team to develop and customize software
for power system controls and optimizations. 
The everyday work was C and Fortran programming. 
In mid 2001, my wife got her Ph.D. in biology and
found a job in Maine. I quitted my job and moved with her.
<p>
From July 2001 to August 2005,
I worked as a scientific software engineer 
at <a href="http://www.jax.org">The Jackson Laboratory</a>
in <a href="http://research.jax.org/faculty/churchill/index.html">
Dr. Gary Churchill's statistical genetics group</a>. 
I learnt a lot in those four
years through my work and was exposed to the fancinating
world of genetic and genomic researches. 
I developed and co-developed
several software packages for QTL mapping and gene expression microarray
data analysis. See <a href="software.html">Software page</a> for details.
<p>
I became a senior software engineer in early
2005 and felt the learning curve was saturated as a programmer.
I had an urge to go back to graduate school and
study math/statistics and biology in a systematical and rigorous way. 
My major career goal at that time was to find an 
academic position and conduct independent research on
biostatistics/bioinformatics/computational biology. 
<p>
My five-year Ph.D. study was full of struggle, depression, sleepless nights, 
as well as enjoyment. I obtained my degree in 2010 and found a tenure track position. 
Since then I have been fully enjoying the academic freedom and 
intellectual challenges, and working on problems I'm interested in.


<p>
In my leisure time I listen to music and participate
different sports including running, swimming, soccer and tennis.
I especially enjoy playing soccer and tennis with my
two boys and watching them play in the tournaments.
