title: My research interests
description: Hao Wu's research

I am a computational biologist/bioinformatician with formal training in biostatistics.
My research has been mainly focused on developing statistical methods and computational tools
for analyzing and interpreting biological or clinical data.
<p>
At this moment, I spent most of my time on developing methods and tools for
analyzing data from various types of second generation sequencing experiments,
including:

- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA-Seq">RNA-seq</a>: differential expression,
power and sample size calculation.

- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChIP-sequencing">ChIP-seq</a>:
peak calling, differential binding.

- <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisulfite_sequencing">BS-seq</a>:
differential methylation analysis.


On the application side, I'm very interested in epigenetic regulation of
gene expressions and their associations with  different types
of diseases. I closely collaborate with basic scientists and clinicians
to study different types of DNA methylation and histone modifications.
