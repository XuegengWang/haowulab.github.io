<h2>My research interests</h2><p>
I am a computational biologist/bioinformatician with formal training in biostatistics. 
My researches have been focused on developing statistical methods and computational tools 
for analyzing and interpreting biological or clinical data. 
<p>
At this moment, I spent most of my time on developing methods and tools for 
analyzing data from various types of second generation sequencing experiments,
including:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA-Seq">RNA-seq</a>: differential expression,
power and sample size calculation.
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChIP-sequencing">ChIP-seq</a>:
peak calling, differential binding. 
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisulfite_sequencing">BS-seq</a>:
differential methylation analysis. 
</ul>

On the application side, I'm very interested in epigenetic regulation of 
gene expressions and their associations with  different types
of diseases. I closely collaborate with basic scientists and clinicians 
to study different types of DNA methylation and histone modifications.
